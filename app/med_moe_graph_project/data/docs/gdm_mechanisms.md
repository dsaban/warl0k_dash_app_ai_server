# GDM core mechanisms (excerpt-style notes)

Maternal glucose crosses the placenta via facilitated diffusion. Maternal insulin does not cross the placenta.

With maternal hyperglycemia, fetal glucose exposure rises, stimulating the fetal pancreas to increase insulin secretion. Fetal insulin acts as a potent growth factor and promotes nutrient storage and tissue growth, including adipose deposition.

Placental nutrient transport can be upregulated in diabetic pregnancy, including glucose transporters (GLUTs). Insulin signaling can activate mTOR pathways linked to cell growth and proliferation. Increased amino acid transport (System A / System L) can contribute to fetal overgrowth.

The modified Pedersen hypothesis links maternal hyperglycemia to fetal hyperinsulinemia and ultimately fetal macrosomia.
