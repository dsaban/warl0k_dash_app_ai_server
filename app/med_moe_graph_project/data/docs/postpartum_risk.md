# Obesity, inflammation, and long-term risk after GDM

Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and altered adipokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 can impair insulin signaling and worsen insulin resistance.

After a GDM pregnancy, some individuals have persistent insulin resistance and dysglycemia postpartum. This can contribute to endothelial dysfunction and cardiometabolic risk, including progression toward metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

GDM can be used as a clinical model: pregnancy increases insulin resistance; beta cells compensate by increasing insulin secretion. If compensation is insufficient, hyperglycemia emerges during pregnancy and can foreshadow future metabolic disease.
