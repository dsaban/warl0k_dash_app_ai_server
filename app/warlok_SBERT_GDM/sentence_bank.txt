A structured search was conducted across PubMed and Google Scholar, supplemented by targeted screening of guideline repositories from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and World Health Organization (WHO).
Included studies and guidelines were selected based on relevance to diagnosis, therapeutic strategies, or maternal-neonatal outcomes, with exclusion criteria applied to non-English publications and non-clinical recommendations.
A comparative analysis of guidelines from the ADA, NICE, and WHO was performed to evaluate prevalence, therapeutic approaches, and postpartum management.
Early diagnosis, stringent blood glucose control, and multidisciplinary care with the aim to avoid macrosomia, congenital abnormalities, and neonatal hypoglycemia guide the management guidelines.
Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (<6.5%) optimization and supplementation with folic acid are critically required prior to conception in all women with previously diagnosed diabetes.
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pump therapy are valued but burdened by availability and access constraints.
A postpartum visit with 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 4-12 weeks is essential for the detection of persistent diabetes.
Variation of diagnostic criteria among guidelines reflects the requirement for standardization.
Expansion of coverage by insurance for CGM and preconception care is important for providing equal access.
The cost-effectiveness of new technologies and health disparities in low-resource settings must be addressed in future research.
Its control requires stringent glycemic regulation to limit adverse effects.
Diabetes can be classified broadly into two categories: pre-gestational diabetes, which involves type 1 and type 2 diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which emerges during pregnancy and corrects after delivery.
Global GDM prevalence is 2-10%, with low- and middle-income countries having a higher prevalence due to inadequate access to health care.
GDM is present in 15-25% of pregnancies in the UAE, where it is driven by obesity and genetic susceptibility, while pre-existing diabetes is seen in 1-3% of pregnancies [1].
The prevalence of GDM significantly varies depending on population and diagnostic criteria and has been estimated to affect between 2% and 10% of pregnancies worldwide [2].
The risk for both maternal and fetal complications is increased with both pre-existing and gestational diabetes.
Maternal risks include preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and worsening of pre-existing diabetes.
In contrast, fetal risks include macrosomia, birth defects, preterm birth, neonatal hypoglycemia, and long-term risks such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life [3].
This review compares the guidelines on diabetes management in pregnancy such as preconception care, screening, and therapeutic interventions, emphasizing the need for early intervention and health equity.
Review Preconception period Preconception care is essential for reducing pregnancy complications in women with diabetes.
For those with pre-existing diabetes, maintaining glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) <6.5% before conception can lower the risk of congenital anomalies by up to 70% [1].
Also, the goal is to convert from teratogenic medication, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, to insulin safely, attain the best possible control, and minimize risk while changing medication [3].
It has been seen that women with a family history of diabetes, a history of GDM, or a history of having given birth to a macrosomic baby are at higher risk of developing GDM, and thus early intervention is critical [4].
In addition, pre-existing diabetes in women is complicated by aggravated retinopathy, nephropathy, hypertension, and preeclampsia.
Screening for complications and cardiovascular status is, thus, most critical [5].
Pre-existing diabetes in women carries a high risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) compared to women without diabetes.
High evidence is available for low-dose folate use to prevent NTDs and perhaps other congenital defects.
Women with diabetes are recommended an increased dose of folate, with a total daily intake of up to 5 mg from three months prior to conception.
This must be incorporated into an individualized preconception care plan, as required for the patient, to optimize maternal and fetal well-being and reduce risks of pregnancy complications [6].
Despite the evidence, preconception counseling is only given to 30-50%, highlighting care shortcomings [7].
Screening for diabetes in early pregnancy The incidence of T2DM among women of childbearing age is rising.
Since T2DM often presents without symptoms in its initial stages and women with significant hyperglycemia early in pregnancy face a higher risk of adverse outcomes, early detection and treatment of diabetes are paramount.
Anyone above the cut-off is considered high risk by interpretation.
To confirm a diagnosis of overt diabetes, FPG and HbA1c measurements should ideally be repeated twice.
While HbA1c is useful for screening diabetes, its lower sensitivity in pregnancy, due to erythrocyte turnover, limits its utility for GDM [8].
Clinical guidelines of GDM: overview Clinical guidelines on the management of diabetes in pregnancy have been developed by several prestigious professional associations like ADA, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and WHO.
These guidelines are based on evidence from a variety of sources, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and expert consensus.
These are regularly updated to include new scientific evidence and advances in clinical practice.
Specifically, their guidelines are developed to enhance maternal and fetal outcomes and ensure optimal management of diabetes throughout pregnancy.
Their guidelines also stress the need for a multidisciplinary team to manage diabetes in pregnant women, which may include obstetricians, endocrinologists, dietitians, and diabetes educators [9].
GDM is a common complication of pregnancy, and its usual method of diagnosis is screening for glucose intolerance.
Both ADA 2023 and NICE 2022 recommend universal screening for GDM between 24-28 weeks of gestation with a 75 g OGTT [10].
However, high-risk populations such as those with a BMI of 30 or more, a family history of diabetes, and a prior history of GDM or macrosomia should undergo screening earlier than 15 weeks of gestation to detect potential glucose intolerance before it worsens [11].
The guidelines of the ADA (2023) recommend the 75 g OGTT with the following cut-off points for diagnosis: fasting glucose ≥92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L), a one-hour level of ≥180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L), and a two-hour level of ≥153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L).
Moreover, WHO’s diagnostic thresholds include fasting glucose ≥92 mg/dL and a two-hour ≥153 mg/dL [11].
Rising GDM incidence correlates with increasing maternal age and obesity.
Despite these minor variations in the diagnostic criteria, early detection and intervention have been agreed upon by both societies as the most crucial factor in the management of GDM [12].
Early detection of the condition allows timely treatment to be instituted that can diminish the risks of maternal complications such as preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and worsening of pre-existing diabetes, and fetal complications such as macrosomia, birth defects, and neonatal hypoglycemia [10].
Further, it is also emphasized in some recommendations that children born to women with GDM have long-term risks of obesity and later development of T2DM, thus requiring follow-up care for many years after delivery [13].
Moreover, children born to women with GDM can inherit type 1 diabetes despite glycemic control [14].
Management of pre-existing diabetes Pre-existing diabetes control consists of optimizing HbA1c before conception, throughout pregnancy, and after delivery in order to prevent congenital malformations and stillbirth as well as for screening complications and education on hypoglycemia.
Strict glycemic control is especially important to improve pregnancy outcomes and decrease maternal and fetal complications since uncontrolled blood glucose is dangerous in terms of causing maternal and fetal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia, macrosomia, and birth defects [15].
The ADA (2023) also recommended folic acid supplementation to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, and tests for cardiovascular health, renal function, and diabetic complication screening like retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy [16].
The ADA and NICE-recommended targets are the preprandial blood glucose levels between 70-95 mg/dL (3.9-5.3 mmol/L) and less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) one hour after meals [17].
It must be noted that early pregnancy hyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations, while hyperglycemia later in pregnancy results in fetal overgrowth (macrosomia) and other complications such as shoulder dystocia during delivery [18].
Insulin treatment remains the mainstay of treatment in most women with established diabetes.
Whereas oral medications like metformin and glyburide are potentially available to use, the drugs are infrequently utilized in pregnancy, specifically pre-gestational status, due to potential issues of safety and fetal welfare, especially in the first trimester.
Basal-bolus insulin therapy can be included and adjusted to fit the patient, whose needs might vary during the pregnancy as with increased insulin resistance.
The management plan must be comprehensive, for example, regular blood glucose monitoring (self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)) to guide insulin adjustments to maintain the target range of glucose [9].
Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) CGM is becoming increasingly popular in diabetes management in pregnancy because it can potentially provide real-time data and prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
CGM decreases hypoglycemia and HbA1c by 0.5% compared to SMBG [19].
CGM is not without issues, including barriers to use, with about 40% of the patients being non-adherent, concerns about fear of hypoglycemia, and expense, with the cost being about $300 per month for the uninsured.
Such patients require frequent antenatal follow-ups for medication dose adjustment, checking of maternal health, and evaluation of fetal growth, preferably with ultrasound for checking for signs of macrosomia or other pathology.
Regular screening should also be performed for complications like preeclampsia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or urinary tract infection so that early intervention may be done.
Multidisciplinary teamwork needs to be given due attention by obstetricians, endocrinologists, dietitians, and other healthcare providers in order to take care of and deal with the complex needs of pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes [9].
Insulin Pump Therapy An RCT in 2017 established that insulin pumps improve glycemic control in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.
It showed that women receiving insulin pumps had much better HbA1c levels, fewer severe hypoglycemic events by 35%, and fewer rates of neonatal hypoglycemia compared to women receiving insulin injections [20].
Moreover, fewer neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions were experienced.
These studies affirm the benefits of insulin pumps in achieving optimal glucose control and reducing undesirable outcomes.
Insulin pumps, although beneficial, require careful monitoring and pose some drawbacks, including a risk of infection due to inadequate site rotation and limited access or coverage, particularly in low-resource settings where cost is likely to be a significant barrier [21].
Pregnant women on insulin pumps should have good hygiene practices, such as frequent site rotation of the infusion, to minimize such risks.
Additionally, technical problems in insulin pumps, such as malfunction or failure of the pump, can cause interruptions in insulin infusion.
If the pump fails, the patient will be required to have a backup, normally reverting to a subcutaneous infusion of insulin.
It is here that patient education on how to navigate such a situation becomes useful.
The cost of insulin pumps may also be a major constraint in areas where insurance does not cover the pump or the supplies for it.
Accessibility of insulin pumps is also restricted in some countries and healthcare systems; thus, not all pregnant women with diabetes will be able to use them.
Monitoring of Complications Besides optimization of insulin delivery, pregnant women with existing diabetes need close monitoring of complications such as hypertensive disorders, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and fetal growth anomalies that can threaten the life of both mother and baby [22].
It has been established that regular ultrasounds need to be done in the second and third trimesters to monitor fetal development and overall status.
The mother's hyperglycemic state causes fetal abnormalities of pregnancy; glucose is transferred from the mother to the fetus through the placenta, resulting in macrosomia, intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, preterm birth, and neonatal hypoglycemia in the newly born infants [23].
The severity of such complications has a close relation to the control of maternal glycemia, with the highest risk to both mother and fetus if diabetes is inadequately controlled.
Furthermore, maternal complications of preeclampsia, cesarean section, and worsening of underlying diabetes can complicate the pregnancy [24].
Proper glucose control throughout pregnancy is greatly important and helps promote maternal and fetal outcomes by minimizing the risks mentioned above.
Fetal complications Diabetic gestation sequelae in the fetus are many and may have severe effects on the baby's short- and long-term health.
One of the most common and severe short-term sequelae is macrosomia, birth weight greater than 4000-4500 grams, with a 26% incidence rate [25].
It occurs as a result of hyperglycemia in the maternal circulation, which crosses the placenta and leads to fetal hyperinsulinemia.
Because of this, the fetus is overgrown and may suffer several birth injuries, such as shoulder dystocia (3-12% rate of incidence), brachial plexus injury, and fractures of the clavicle [26].
Furthermore, macrosomic neonates are prone to neonatal hypoglycemia (25% incidence rate) since the intrauterine hyperglycemic environment leads their pancreas to continue releasing excess insulin, and their blood glucose can fall sharply once glucose transfer from the placenta is stopped after birth.
In the long term, in-utero exposure to high blood glucose levels is linked to a 1.5-fold higher risk of obesity in children and a 7.4-fold higher risk of T2DM [27,28].
Respiratory distress syndrome also happens more often in infants of mothers with diabetes, especially when maternal blood glucose control is inadequate.
The reason for this is impaired surfactant production within the lungs which causes the newborn to breathe poorly [29].
Congenital malformations are another significant risk in newborns of women with poorly controlled pre-existing diabetes, particularly if blood glucose is elevated in the first trimester when organogenesis occurs.
Uncontrolled maternal blood glucose levels interfere with normal fetal growth, creating structural defects.
A few congenital anomalies seen in pregnancies complicated by maternal hyperglycemia are cardiac malformations like ventricular septal defects, neural tube defects like spina bifida, renal malformations like renal agenesis, and osseous dysplasias like caudal regression syndrome.
Optimal glucose control during the pre-conceptual period and in the first trimester of pregnancy has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of such anomalies [30].
In addition, both pre-existing diabetes and GDM have been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth, particularly with poor control of maternal blood glucose.
Hyperglycemia also causes placental insufficiency, which damages the blood and oxygen supply to the fetus and generates increased risks of fetal mortality.
Studies show that tight regulation of blood glucose in pregnancy can reduce the risk of stillbirth [31].
This risk does not diminish once gross birth defects and complications in children of diabetic women, poorly controlled in this case, have been avoided; children are at lifetime risk for disease, including obesity as a child and T2DM.
It has been suggested that the following heightened risk is due to the intrauterine environment, with fetal overinsulin production and abnormal growth patterns setting the stage for later metabolic malfunction [32].
Thus, good diabetic control during pregnancy is not only required to reduce the short-term risks of delivery but also to reduce the subsequent chronic disease burden in the infant.
In conclusion, prevention of these serious fetal complications of diabetes relies on excellent maternal blood glucose control along with full prenatal care.
Management of GDM GDM normally reverses after the gestational period.
However, the disease dramatically increases the chance of T2DM in the later years.
Main management priorities in GDM involve attempts toward achieving normoglycemia to prevent complications for the mother and the fetus.
The first line of managing GDM involves changes in lifestyle such as nutrition, in addition to physical activities if allowed by the gynecologist.
However, in some women, lifestyle interventions by themselves often are inadequate for optimum glycemic control.
In cases when glycemic targets cannot be achieved through diet and exercise, pharmacologic therapy is instituted.
Insulin, whether neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) or analogs, remains the first-line treatment, as it does not cross the placenta and has a long-established safety record [9].
Oral medications, such as metformin and glyburide, may be considered if insulin is refused.
The ADA (2023) recommends starting insulin therapy when fasting blood glucose is above 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L) or when postprandial glucose levels are above 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) [8].
This requires close monitoring of blood glucose to adjust insulin dosing and avoid hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
Besides careful maternal blood glucose management, the fetus must also be followed closely.
Regular SMBG is recommended to ensure that maternal glucose levels stay within target ranges.
Fetal surveillance, including routine ultrasounds every four weeks and a fetal echocardiogram if first-trimester hyperglycemia was present, is particularly important in cases of poor glycemic control or suspected macrosomia, as these conditions increase the risk of complications [35].
Given that macrosomic newborns are more likely to suffer birth complications such as shoulder dystocia, time of delivery is crucial.
Most guidelines suggest that pregnant women whose GDM is diet-controlled should be delivered at 39-40 weeks of gestation while those with poor control need to be delivered at 37-38 weeks, though the timing may vary based on individual factors, including glycemic control and fetal growth [36].
Postpartum care GDM women should have close follow-up management for the development of chronic diabetes.
ADA (2023) recommends a two-hour 75 OGTT at 4-12 weeks after delivery to check whether diabetes has remitted or the mother acquires T2DM, and once-a-year screening for diabetes, as 30-50% develop into T2DM in 10 years [9,37].
In addition, breastfeeding has been found to reduce maternal T2DM risk by 32%.
Postpartum care also involves follow-up in the scenario of women with pre-gestational diabetes in order to treat their diabetes and prevent its complications in the long run.
Lifestyle modification education for the reduction of T2DM is also a part of postpartum care [38].
Conclusions The clinical guidelines on the management of diabetes play a crucial role in optimizing maternal and fetal outcomes by providing evidence-based recommendations.
Early diagnosis, tight glycemic control, and follow-up during pregnancy and into the postpartum period are underlined in the guidelines.
If healthcare providers adhere to such recommendations, complications of gestational and pre-existing diabetes would be considerably minimized.
However, as our knowledge of diabetes in pregnancy evolves, further research will always be needed to continue to refine these guidelines.
Besides, health disparities must be addressed to make sure all women, irrespective of their background or access to health care, get the best possible care.
In addition, the recommendation for all insurance providers to cover continuous glucose monitoring and checkups prior to conception may ensure equity of access to preventing diabetes and best management.
It thus behooves sustained efforts to improve the response to diabetes management and support pregnant women with diabetes as one way of ensuring better maternal and child health in developing countries.

Gestational diabetes: update on screening, diagnosis and maternal management SUMMARY Gestational diabetes is common and increasing in prevalence in Australia.
New Australasian consensus recommendations released in June 2025 include higher diagnostic thresholds for gestational diabetes and guidance on early pregnancy screening.
Women with risk factors for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy are recommended to have glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measured in the first trimester.
Women with a previous history of gestational diabetes or a first-trimester HbA1c of 6.0 to 6.4% should undergo a pregnancy oral glucose tolerance test (POGTT) before 20 weeks gestation.
All pregnant women without early gestational diabetes or existing diabetes should undergo a POGTT at 24 to 28 weeks gestation.
Metformin may have a role, but its use should be evaluated on an individual basis.
Other non-insulin antihyperglycaemic therapies are contraindicated in pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and long-term surveillance is indicated.
The management of gestational diabetes continues to evolve as new data emerge, and many recommendations are consensus-driven in the absence of robust evidence.
This article aims to provide an overview of current best-practice diagnosis and treatment of gestational diabetes in Australia, focusing on maternal management during pregnancy and postpartum.
The register provides information, access to subsidised equipment, advice, and after-pregnancy reminders to undertake follow-up screening for the development of permanent diabetes.
Management often utilises a multidisciplinary approach, with involvement of diabetes nurse educators, dietitians, general practitioners, endocrinologists and obstetricians.
Education Women should be provided with education on gestational diabetes – what it is, the potential shortterm implications for their own health and that of their baby in pregnancy (e.g.
Blood glucose monitoring The key to management of gestational diabetes is blood glucose monitoring to ensure glycaemic targets are met (Table 2).
Self-monitoring should be performed using capillary (finger-prick) blood testing at least 4 times a day, including a fasting concentration, and a concentration taken 1 or 2 hours after each meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner).
However, due to the lack of high-quality evidence on optimal targets, there is some variation across centres in Australia, and local guidelines may be referred to.11 If targets are not being achieved following diet and lifestyle modifications, antihyperglycaemic pharmacological therapy is the next step in management.
Insulin In Australia, insulin is most commonly administered as multiple daily injections of rapid-acting insulin analogues, or a single longer acting injection, or both.
Multiple daily injections can be administered before meals (e.g.
NovoRapid [insulin aspart], Humalog [insulin lispro]) and a longer acting insulin at night (e.g.
Fixed‑dose biphasic insulin, such as NovoMix 30 (insulin aspart and insulin aspart protamine) and Humalog Mix25 (insulin lispro and insulin lispro protamine), may be considered for patients unable to use multiple daily injections.
There are limited data on the safety and effectiveness of newer insulin analogues in gestational diabetes, such as Fiasp (fast-acting insulin aspart), Toujeo (insulin glargine U300) and Ryzodeg (insulin degludec and insulin aspart), such that they are not routinely used for this condition in Australia.
The number of injections and doses depends on the individual’s glycaemic profile, with rapid-acting insulin used to manage elevated postprandial glucose and longer acting insulin used to manage elevated fasting glucose.
Protocols that guide self-titration of insulin doses are increasingly being used when appropriate.
Metformin Metformin has been widely used in the treatment of hyperglycaemia.28 However, there is conflicting evidence regarding its safety and efficacy in gestational diabetes.
While not currently endorsed by ADIPS for routine use in the treatment of gestational diabetes, the appropriateness of metformin use should be evaluated on an individual basis.4 Metformin may be appropriate in the presence of maternal needle phobia, for limiting insulin use, or in context of excessive maternal weight gain with insulin.
These drugs have limited data on their use in pregnancy and, through known mechanisms of action, have potential to cause fetal harm.
In the early stages of labour, or if fasting for a caesarean section, insulin doses may be reduced (e.g.
As gestational diabetes is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (twofold), cardiovascular disease risk factors should be regularly assessed and managed.38 Optimisation of lifestyle factors remains key in prevention of progression to type 2 diabetes.
Surveillance provides an avenue for early detection and subsequent commencement of appropriate therapies to prevent progression to uncontrolled hyperglycaemia and diabetes-related complications.
Conclusion All women should be screened at 24 to 28 weeks gestation, and those with high-risk features should be tested in early pregnancy.
Lifestyle modifications, plus insulin if pharmacological therapy is required, remain the mainstay of treatment.
All women diagnosed with gestational diabetes should be screened lifelong for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

GDM is a significant pregnancy complication in which women who have never had diabetes acquire chronic hyperglycemia during their gestational period.
In most cases, hyperglycemia is caused by impaired glucose tolerance caused by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction in the background of chronic insulin resistance.
Being overweight or obese, having an older mother age, and having a family history of any type of diabetes are all risk factors for developing GDM.
GDM consequences include a higher risk of maternal cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, as well as macrosomia and delivery difficulties in the newborn.
There is also a longer-term risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in the infant.
Premature birth, hypoglycemia at birth, and shoulder dystocia are also a few of the fetal problems that can result from GDM.
Unfortunately, there is no widely acknowledged treatment or preventative strategy for GDM at the moment, except lifestyle modification (diet and exercise) and, on occasion, insulin therapy, which is only of limited value due to the insulin resistance that is commonly present.
Although new oral medications for diabetes management, such as glyburide and metformin, show potential, there are ongoing worries regarding their safety over an extended period for both the mother and the child.
By identifying gaps in the research, it calls for further investigations and a multidisciplinary approach, ultimately aiming to enhance the management and care for women with GDM, which would impact these affected individuals indubitably.
Around 9% of pregnancies around the globe are affected by this prevalent antepartum condition [2].
Although one can develop GDM at any instance during the entire course of pregnancy, it is typically seen between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy.
Additionally, the prevalence of GDM is growing globally due to an increase in maternal weight gain, maternal age, and inactivity [3].
The etiology of GDM is explained by the maternal pancreas' inability to adjust to the increased insulin demand throughout gestation.
During pregnancy, the body becomes less responsive to insulin, which leads to an increased production of insulin by pancreatic beta cells [4].
Insulin, which is secreted by these beta cells, plays a vital role in promoting the uptake of glucose by peripheral tissues, reducing the synthesis of glucose in the liver, and controlling the release of lipids from adipose tissue.
However, if regular levels of insulin fail to achieve the desired response from insulin receptors, insulin resistance can develop.
Consequently, beta cells must produce more insulin than usual to maintain normal maternal blood glucose levels [1].
This insulin resistance is a natural part of a healthy pregnancy and is induced by placental hormones to ensure the fetus receives the necessary nourishment for proper growth and development.
Maternal beta cells respond by increasing their number, insulin production, and release to sustain glucose balance despite insulin resistance [5].
However, when maternal beta cells cannot adapt to the metabolic changes associated with pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) results in hyperglycemia.
GDM is essential to detect and treat during pregnancy due to the harmful impact it has on both the mother and the fetus, in both the short and long runs.
Gestational diabetes can cause short-term pregnancy complications such as high blood pressure, the necessity for a cesarean section (C-section), pre-eclampsia, and difficulty during childbirth [6].
In the long run, it may reappear in subsequent pregnancies, increasing the mother's risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life [7,8].
Many recent researches have focused on treating GDM with GM-targeting techniques.
Several prior research have looked at the influence of probiotics on the progression of GDM, but results have been ambiguous.
GDM treatment tries to reduce the hazards for both the mother and the infant by controlling excessive blood sugar levels.
Mothers must learn about the illness in order to achieve the best possible blood sugar control in GDM patients.
The primary therapies for GDM involve adopting lifestyle changes such as modifying your diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight.
Medication may be an option if high blood sugar persists despite all of these changes.
GDM medication comprises glucose-lowering drugs, metformin, glibenclamide, and insulin [9].
Women having GDM are recommended to discontinue any medication they were using for the condition postpartum due to the quick return of insulin sensitivity [10].
Additionally, we looked through the bibliographies of pertinent research to find important references.
Two reviewers independently checked the retrieved papers against the inclusion criteria based on the title and abstract first and then the full texts (Figure 1).
Figure 1 Open in a new tab PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Effects on the mother GDM subsequently causes several short- and long-term complications with regard to maternal health.
Along with the challenges of a typical pregnancy, GDM may contribute to depression in prenatal [11].
In many instances, the baby must be delivered surgically due to the increased risk of issues in subsequent pregnancies, such as premature birth and hypertension [12].
Women who have been diagnosed with GDM are significantly more likely to develop diabetes mellitus later in life.
Nearly 10% of women with gestational diabetes mellitus are diagnosed with diabetes mellitus shortly post giving birth [13].
Without particular interventions to lower their chance of developing diabetes mellitus, the remainder seem to develop the disease at rates of 20%-60% within 5-10 years following the index pregnancy.
However, not all women having gestational diabetes will develop diabetes mellitus, according to limited long-term data from O'Sullivan, but most of them will [14].
Similar to prenatal issues, the risk of postpartum diabetes mellitus is increased by GDM.
Regardless, the risk of prenatal problems brought on by GDM is substantially lower than the likelihood of the mother developing diabetes mellitus post-GDM diagnosis.
Therefore, it is logical to assume that GDM is a type of prediabetes similar to glucose intolerance in non-pregnant people [15].
Plenty of patients who have diabetes mellitus after GDM meet the pre-type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) profile, as was previously discussed.
Studies on the regulation of glucose following GDM over time show declining beta cell remuneration for insulin resistance (chronic) that may also deteriorate as time passes [16].
Markers of rather severe decompensation, such as elevated glucose levels, noticeable insulin resistance, and impaired beta cell activity, are risk factors for the relatively quick onset of diabetes mellitus following childbirth.
Women exhibiting these traits might surpass the threshold of glucose levels defining diabetes mellitus following a slight decline in their physical condition [17].
Weight increase, insulin resistance, increasing C-reactive protein levels, and declining adiponectin levels are risk factors for beta cell deterioration at comparatively high rates, which leads to diabetes mellitus [18].
These results imply that the metabolic consequences of obesity serve a key role in the degeneration of beta cells that result in diabetes mellitus.
As will be covered below, the most effective defense against the emergence of T2DM after GDM is the amelioration of the detrimental consequences of obesity induced by diet and exercise or by taking medications that improve the biological makeup and operation of adipose tissue [19].
Figure 2 aids in comprehending the multifaceted nature of post-GDM diabetes development and highlights the significance of managing beta cell function and addressing obesity to mitigate this risk effectively.
Metabolic factors influencing post-GDM: the role of beta cell function and obesity management.
Figure 2 Open in a new tab GDM: gestational diabetes mellitus Image credits: Vaishnavi Nakshine Metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity and other associated diseases, serves as the foundation upon which T2DM develops.
The probability of women with GDM displaying symptoms of metabolic syndrome is higher than it is for women without GDM [17].
A greater frequency of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular events is also linked to previous episodes of GDM [20].
Most mothers who have GDM are obese, and a sizable fraction of obese people also have GDM [21].
According to a meta-analysis, pregnant women who are overweight are 2.14 times more susceptible to be diagnosed with GDM than pregnant women average in weight, obese pregnant women are 3.56 times more likely to do so, and extremely obese pregnant women are 8.56 times more likely [22].
Complications During Pregnancy Vaginal birth will be more challenging in case the baby is very large.
There is a chance of a long labor process during which the fetus could get clung in the birth/vaginal canal, an instrumental delivery may be required (using forceps or a vacuum), or even an unanticipated or emergency cesarean section might be required.
A perineal tear (muscle tearing between the vagina and the anus) as well as lacerations and tears of the vaginal tissue are more likely to occur during childbirth than when the infant is of normal size [23].
Heavy bleeding and postpartum hemorrhage may occur as a result of the uterus' muscle failing to contract appropriately.
Macrosomic births have an about three- to fivefold increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage and genital tract injury [24].
In addition, if the woman has already undergone a cesarean section, there is an increased probability of tearing of the uterus along the surgical scar tissue from the prior procedure.
Fetal complications and effects Premature Birth Preterm delivery is possible as a result of inducing labor early (earlier than 39 weeks and/or early rupturing of the membrane).
Although every effort has been made to induce early labor, babies are still at risk for prematurity-related problems, such as breathing and feeding issues, infections, jaundice, admission to a neonatal ICU, and perinatal mortality.
Preterm delivery has a prevalence of roughly 10.6% worldwide when combined with several other problematic factors such as obesity and hypertension during pregnancy [25].
Hypoglycemia at Birth In addition to having a negative impact on mothers, GDM also harms the fetus.
The growing fetus can only produce a small amount of glucose; hence, it gets the majority of its glucose from the mother's blood.
While maternal insulin does not pass the placenta, maternal glucose does.
The modified Pedersen's theory, therefore, states that regardless of glucose stimulation, greater fetal insulin production results from extra glucose transported across the placenta in high and uncontrolled maternal glucose levels [22].
This is corroborated by the placental expression of glucose transport proteins (GLUTs) being found to be higher in pregnancies with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [26].
Additionally, insulin is known to have the ability to activate mTOR, a powerful controller of cell proliferation.
The placenta's system A and system L amino acid transporters boost cell division and the supply of essential nutrients to the fetus as a result of elevated maternal insulin, which also causes a surge in placental mTOR activity [27].
Maternal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia can result in alterations in the fetus that are comparable to those found in GDM due to the aforementioned causes, which can result in neonatal obesity [28].
An increase in neonatal size at birth, also known as macrosomia, is the result of excessive nutrition storage.
The majority of fat is centered in the fetal abdomen and shoulders.
Macrosomic babies are born in 15%-45% of GDM pregnancies [22].
Additionally, GDM has been linked to a higher incidence of respiratory distress in newborns [1].
Shoulder Dystocia and Erb's Palsy Shoulder dystocia, particularly linked to birth trauma, is one of the most serious consequences of administering delivery through the vagina, specifically in macrosomic infants.
Newborns weighing 4,500 g or greater are six times more likely than others to experience birth trauma [23], and furthermore, if the birth weight is above 4,500 g, there is an almost 20-fold increased chance of brachial plexus damage [29].
Congenital Anomalies The most prevalent birth problems include heart defects and disorders of the neural tube, including spina bifida.
Congenital abnormalities can result from the growing fetus' organ damage caused by the elevated blood sugar levels of women with GDM [30].
Furthermore, it is not certain if GDM and fetal anomalies are related.
Congenital abnormalities are twice as common in women with pre-existing diabetes as they are in non-diabetic individuals, demonstrating a strong association between the two diseases.
Fetal Nutrition With the onset of GDM, changes in breast milk composition are seen too.
Breast milk is a continuously changing fluid with bioactivity that greatly varies from female to female and from phase to phase.
Numerous maternal variables, including term and preterm labor, maternal diet, metabolic problems, and diseases [31], have an impact on it.
Diabetes mellitus is a long-term metabolic condition that may affect expectant mothers whether it develops before pregnancy or if it develops during pregnancy (a newly formed syndrome) [32].
Citrate, lactose, and total nitrogen levels take 15-24 hours longer for mothers with gestational diabetes to attain levels that are comparable to those of healthy women [33].
Due to the beneficial correlation between mammary gland growth during pregnancy and circulating levels of human placental lactogen, women having gestational diabetes during their pregnancy may have a delay at the beginning of breast milk [34].
Pregnant women affected by gestational DM exhibited elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines in their colostrum.
Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-15, and interferon-γ levels were up, whereas IL-1ra and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) levels were decreased.
This led to a modified immune composition of the colostrum [35].
Neonatal complications Neonatal complications can include delivery trauma, such as shoulder dystocia and a brachial plexus wound, as well as potential hypoxia, hypoglycemia, kernicterus, and jaundice.
They may also include bacterial infections and newborn respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) [2].
Neonatal Jaundice Prematurity, inadequate nutrition, and increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin due to decreased hepatic conjugation of bilirubin are some factors that may contribute to jaundice.
Neonates with macrosomia have an elevated oxygen demand, which leads to elevated erythropoiesis and, ultimately, polycythemia [36].
As a consequence of this, as these cells degrade, bilirubin (a by-product of red blood cells) rises, which causes newborn jaundice.
Childhood and adulthood complications It is generally known that GDM and hyperglycemia in children are related.
The research of the Pima Indians in the USA was the first concrete proof that a mother's hyperglycemia may cause her offspring to develop an adult illness.
Indeed, children who have diabetic mothers experience an increased risk of obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in later adulthood [37].
In 10 different countries, researchers from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study discovered a direct link between maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy and a rise in hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in children as they grew older [38].
Additionally, compared to offspring of mothers with normal blood sugar levels, GDM progeny had a higher homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), waist measurement, body mass index (BMI), and triglyceride levels [39].
With about 20% of offspring resulting from GDM having type 2 diabetes and prediabetes by 22, it is plausible that the development of being resistant to insulin raises the chance of the child getting the disease [40].
Along with an increased risk of illnesses including cardiovascular conditions and resistance to insulin, the greater incidence of obesity in children of women with GDM is also linked to an increased risk of other diseases [40].
In addition to hyperglycemia and BMI, children delivered to GDM mothers were shown to have considerably greater cardiovascular risk and adiposity.
GDM kids are more likely to experience cardiac arrhythmias and require hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as a result of increased cardiovascular risk [39].
In addition, GDM offspring are 29% more likely to suffer early-onset cardiovascular conditions such as cardiac failure, high blood pressure, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism [41].
All of these researches indicate that the environment in utero affects how metabolic illness is programmed in the child.
Population studies have shown that all of these changes experienced throughout childhood are probably to last into adulthood.
Numerous studies also indicate that the long-duration impacts of in utero GDM subjection often do not manifest themselves until adolescence, another period that is particularly vulnerable to the development of obesity [23].
Treatment A comprehensive strategy is needed to handle an individual with GDM as best as possible.
This entails educating patients on managing pregnancy weight gain, dietary adjustments, nutritional monitoring, and regulating one's blood sugar levels.
With enough exercise, dietary changes, and lifestyle adjustments, up to 70%-85% of those with gestational diabetes are curable [42].
Figure 3 provides a concise overview of the management strategies to be employed for controlling GDM.
Figure 3 Open in a new tab GDM: gestational diabetes mellitus Image credits: Vaishnavi Nakshine Blood Glucose Monitoring The majority of organizations advise daily at-home self-glucose monitoring.
Presently, daily self-monitoring of postprandial and fasting blood glucose levels is encouraged.
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) advises that the target blood sugar levels be 95 mg/dL for fasting and 140 mg/dL or 120 mg/dL for one to two hours, respectively, following a meal.
Pre-existing diabetics are the main beneficiaries of pre-prandial glucose monitoring.
Screening the levels of hemoglobin A1C is not as helpful for evaluating glucose control in GDM [43].
Dietary Modifications Some of the dietary strategies mentioned in the literature include the DASH diet (dietary techniques to treat hypertension), calorie-restricted diets, low-glycemic index diets, low-carbohydrate diets, low-unsaturated fat diets, high-fiber diets, and soy-based diets.
The emphasis of nutritional advice should be on a balanced diet with reasonable portion sizes, healthy fats, complex carbs, and 20% protein [44].
Physical Exercise Even in pregnant women with GDM, physical activity and regular exercise have been promoted and are encouraged.
The benefits of moderate exercise during pregnancy include a lower risk of gestational diabetes, a lower potential of larger-than-normal newborns, and a lower risk of high blood pressure problems, preterm birth, and fetal growth restriction [45].
Additionally, pregnancy-related lifestyle modifications affect the period of postpartum, reducing the chance of postpartum depression [46].
Pharmacotherapy for GDM Management In about 15%-30% of GDM patients, blood glucose management is insufficient despite suggested dietary and lifestyle changes, necessitating the use of medication [43].
Usually, if hyperglycemia still exists throughout the course of the day after 10-14 days of nutritional and daily living changes, medication courses should be taken into account.
Insulin and oral-route medications are administered for patients with gestational diabetes mellitus in order to control hyperglycemia [47].
The oral medications that have been researched include metformin and sulfonylureas such as glyburide.
Large molecules such as insulin cannot pass through the placenta.
Metformin and glyburide have been demonstrated to have the capacity to pass the placental barrier and reach the fetus [48].

[1] 2020 This review emphasizes the seriousness of GDM and the problems involved with its care, such as recognizing and dealing with risk factors, accurate diagnosis, and treatment of the condition to avoid associated consequences.
[2] 2016 GDM is becoming more common in most populations, and it is extremely certain that GDM is contributing to the global diabetes epidemic.
[3] 2022 The one-step approach resulted in two to three times the number of women being diagnosed with GDM as the two-step approach.
[4] 2010 The findings suggest that maternal glycemia during pregnancy may have a long-term effect on offspring obesity risk.
[5] 1992 The findings represent the first systematic examination of alterations in islet function throughout pregnancy in rats.
Furthermore, they provide evidence that rPL-I may be the essential hormone signal that initiates the fundamental adaptive alterations in islet function associated with pregnancy.
[7] 2012 GDM is associated with a significantly elevated risk of unfavorable perinatal outcomes, with insulin-treated GDM having a greater probability of most outcomes than non-insulin-treated GDM.
HAPO Study Cooperative Research Group [8] 2008 Studies show an effective, consistent relationship between reduced maternal glucose levels and increased birth weight and cord blood serum C-peptide levels.
American Diabetes Association [9] 2004 The risk of GDM should be assessed during the first prenatal checkup.
[11] 2015 According to the findings, depressive symptoms are widespread during the antepartum period, so assessment and education about this illness are critical.
A history of depression may also be a warning sign for the onset of GDM.
[12] 2009 Women who tested positive for GCT had a higher risk of having an unfavorable pregnancy outcome.
[13] 2012 Even among the vast majority of women who do not have autoimmunity or monogenic diabetes, there is significant variation in GDM.
[14] 2010 This paper can be used as the basis for internationally recognized guidelines for the diagnosis and classification of diabetes during gestation by diabetes, obstetrics, and other organizations.
[15] 2005 The research found that the prevalence of GDM is rising in a multiethnic community that has been universally screened.
The growing incidence of GDM shows that the vicious cycle of diabetes in pregnancy initially identified among Pima Indians may be spreading to other ethnic communities in the United States.
[16] 2010 Women who are the most behind at diagnosis and/or deteriorate the fastest are particularly likely to get type 2 diabetes within 12 years after the index pregnancy.
[17] 2010 GDM and mild glucose intolerance during pregnancy significantly indicate an elevated risk of metabolic syndrome at three months postpartum, lending credence to the idea that women with prenatal dysglycemia may have an underlying latent metabolic syndrome.
[18] 2010 Weight gain is the main predictor related to deteriorating beta cell compensation for insulin resistance in Hispanic women at high risk of type 2 diabetes, according to these findings.
This effect could be mediated by at least two mechanisms: changes in adipokine levels and increased insulin resistance.
[19] 2007 The findings in a multiethnic US sample imply that hyperglycemia during pregnancy is linked to an increased risk of juvenile obesity.
[20] 2009 Women with diabetes during pregnancy and women who had an oral glucose tolerance test but did not have gestational diabetes had an increased risk of cardiovascular disease after a 12.3-year median follow-up when compared with women who were not given a test for oral glucose tolerance.
[21] 2012 Medical therapies that prevent the progression of T2DM, such as metformin, might turn out to be our major line of defense against CVD in women with GDM.
[22] 2004 This study examines research that investigated the impact of GDM and fetal macrosomia on delivery outcomes, as well as macrosomia-related problems, and provides an assessment of mother and fetal health.
[24] 1986 Aside from women who have already delivered a macrosomic child, cesarean delivery of the macrosomic fetus is strongly advised.
[25] 1986 Obesity and pregestational diabetes are both linked to a higher risk of LGA delivery.
[26] 2020 This review looks at how the localization, function, and evolution of placental glucose transport systems vary during fetal development, as well as the transport and metabolic abnormalities seen in prenatal diseases.
[27] 2016 Obese mice with activated placental insulin/IGF-I/mTOR and leptin signaling pathways boost placental amino acid transport and contribute to higher fetal growth.
[28] 2017 IDM patients had much more obesity than NIDM patients.
[29] 1986 Findings show that there is a considerable risk of major birth damage related to instrumental midpelvic delivery.
[31] 2012 Breastfeeding and the usage of human milk provide distinct nutritional and non-nutritional benefits to the infant and mother, which improves infant, child, and adult fitness and child milestones.
[32] 2020 Diabetes along with obesity, in both human and animal models, can disrupt the physiological production and biological action of placental lactogen.
[33] 2021 Maternal diabetes has a major impact on the structure and function of the fetal heart and fetal placental circulation.
[34] 2021 Over 80% of women who delivered prematurely and were producing milk for their newborn had a delayed initiation of lactation, defined as one or more lactogenesis II markers in their milk that were more than 3 SD higher than the mean of full-term women on day 5 postpartum.
[35] 1989 Diabetes causes alterations in lipid metabolism in the mammary gland, which alters the content of the diabetic mother's milk.
[36] 2004 Metformin and glibenclamide drugs may be effective and secure alternatives to insulin for the management of gestational diabetes, with metformin being preferred.
[37] 1983 Obesity develops in childhood and early adulthood as a result of the perinatal environment of diabetic women's infants.
[39] 2010 The fact that overweight risk is mostly connected with maternal obesity shows that genetic predisposition plays a role in childhood growth among these children.
[41] 2019 Offspring of diabetic mothers, particularly those with a history of cardiovascular diseases or diabetic complications, had higher rates of early-onset heart diseases from childhood to early adulthood.
[44] 2020 Regular examinations along with testing, at least once per 1-3 years, are indicated for early detection of type 2 diabetes and to prevent long-term complications of diabetes mellitus.
[45] 2017 Regular exercise throughout pregnancy enhances general wellness and aids in the maintenance of a suitable gestational and fetal weight increase.
[46] 2017 Women who received lifestyle treatments were comparatively less inclined to experience postnatal depression and were more likely to meet their postpartum weight goals.
[47] 2002 A randomized clinical trial of moderate gestational diabetes mellitus determines if early detection and treatment of the condition improve neonatal morbidity.
[48] 2015 Aspart, glargine, and detemir are all safe alternatives for treating diabetes during pregnancy; in this research conducted, these insulin analogs did not increase difficulties for mothers or fetuses.
Open in a new tab Conclusions Global health continues to be seriously impacted by GDM, the most common metabolic condition during pregnancy.
Characterized by elevated blood sugar levels during pregnancy, it demands our attention and a deeper understanding due to its significant impact on the health of expectant mothers and their children.
This review shed light on the immediate and long-term consequences of GDM on pregnant women.
Short-term consequences encompass a higher likelihood of gestational hypertension, cesarean sections, and other perinatal complications.
Long-term implications involve an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes postpartum, highlighting the importance of continued monitoring and care for women who have experienced GDM.
Furthermore, GDM's influence on offspring is a matter of critical concern.
This review underscores that children of GDM-affected mothers face a higher risk of developing conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and insulin resistance, which can persist into adulthood.
Understanding these intergenerational health implications is vital for proactive prevention and management.
To address GDM effectively, a multifaceted approach is required.
This approach includes vigilant blood glucose monitoring, dietary modifications, regular physical activity, and, when necessary, pharmaceutical interventions.
The effective management of GDM relies on a collaborative effort between healthcare professionals and expectant mothers, emphasizing education and tailored care.
A clinical dietitian should provide dietary advice to all women with GDM, as dietary counseling is the cornerstone of GDM treatment.
Particular attention should be paid to carbohydrate intake, as carbohydrate type, amount, and distribution all play a significant role in postprandial blood glucose levels.
While considerable progress has been made in GDM research and treatment, there are still gaps in knowledge and variances in clinical recommendations.
Moreover, a variety of therapy alternatives for GDM are discussed, although existing data do not support the effectiveness of these approaches over the long term.
Future research must focus on a more comprehensive understanding of the long-term cardiometabolic risks that the offspring of GDM-affected mothers may face.
Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy Fathi I Abourawi 1 Author information Article notes Copyright and License information PMCID: PMC3081498 PMID: 21526019 Abstract Diabetes mellitus is the most common medical complication of pregnancy and it carries a significant risk to the foetus and the mother.
Congenital malformations and perinatal morbidity remain common compared with the offspring of non diabetic pregnancies.
Diabetic mothers are at risk of progression of microvascular diabetic complications as well as early pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios and premature labour.
Glycaemic control before and during pregnancy is critical and the benefit may result in a viable, healthy off spring.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) which manifests for the first time during pregnancy is common and on the increase, its proper management will reduce the risk of neonatal macrosomia and hypoglycaemia.
Post-partum evaluation of glucose tolerance and appropriate counselling in women with GDM may help decrease the high risk of subsequent type 2 diabetes in the longterm.
This article will briefly review the changes in the carbohydrate metabolism that characterise normal pregnancy and will focus on a practical approach to the care of patients with pre-existing diabetes as well as GDM.
Keywords: diabetes mellitus, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus, macrosomia INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus is the most common medical complication of pregnancy.
Despite major advances in clinical management, we are still facing a higher incidence of malformations and perinatal morbidity compared to the non-diabetic population.
Over the past 30 years, great strides have been made in improving the outcomes of women with type 1 diabetes who become pregnant.
There are two main changes which are seen during pregnancy, progressive insulin resistance that begins near mid-pregnancy and progresses through the third trimester to the level that approximates the insulin resistance seen in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The insulin resistance appears to result from a combination of increased maternal adiposity and the placental secretion of hormones (progesterone, cortisol, placental lactogen, prolactin and growth hormone).
The fact that insulin resistance rapidly abates following delivery suggests that the major contributors to this state of resistance are placental hormones.
The second change is the compensatory increase in insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cells to overcome the insulin resistance of pregnancy.
As a result, circulating glucose levels are kept within normal.
If there is maternal defect in insulin secretion and in glucose utilisation, then GDM will occur as the diabetogenic hormones rise to their peak levels.
Risks to the Foetus & the Neonate (Tables 1 & 2): if the mother has hyperglycaemia, the foetus will be exposed to either sustained hyperglycaemia or intermittent pulses of hyperglycaemia; both situations prematurely stimulate foetal insulin secretion.
Foetal complications in diabetic pregnancy Congenital anomalies: cardio-vascular central nervous system, skeletal (sacral agenesis), and genito-urinary Excessive foetal growth (macrosomia) Foetal growth retardation (in diabetic pregnancy complicated by nephropathy) Open in a new tab Table 2.
Neonatal complications in diabetic pregnancy Traumatic delivery Pulmonary surfactant deficiency Hypoglycaemia Polycythaemia Hypocalcaemia Hypomagnesaemia Hyperbilirubinaemia Open in a new tab Foetal hyperinsulinaemia may cause increased foetal body fat (macrosomia) resulting in difficult delivery.
It may also cause inhibition of pulmonary maturation of surfactant resulting in respiratory distress of the neonate.
The foetus may also have decreased potassium level caused by elevated insulin and glucose levels, and may therefore have cardiac arrhythmia.
It seems that post-prandial glucose levels are the most important determining factor on the subsequent risk of neonatal macrosomia.
The associated increase of congenital anomalies for the foetus and spontaneous abortion in women with poor glycaemic control appears to be related to maternal glycaemic control rather than to the mode of anti-diabetic therapy during early pregnancy.
The normalisation of maternal glucose before and throughout pregnancy can decrease pregnancy-related complications to those seen in non-diabetic pregnancies.
Studies from many centres have shown that the higher the levels of glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c] in early pregnancy, the greater the incidence of anomalies and the higher the perinatal mortality.
[7–9] Risks to the mother (Table 3): Maternal diabetes complications are frequent in women with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy may progress or start de novo during the pregnancy.
[10] Other complications including polyhydramnios and worsening of chronic hypertension are not uncommon.
Management of Pregnancy in Women with Pre-existing Diabetes: Pre-pregnancy planning (Table 4) is essential to achieve a healthy baby and avoid maternal morbidity such as adverse pregnancy outcomes and progression of chronic diabetes complications.
Ideally this is carried out by a team, which includes an obstetrician and a diabetologist for optimum care.
To minimize the occurrence of these devastating malformations, standard care for all women with diabetes and of childbearing age should include.
Counselling about the risk of malformations associated with unplanned pregnancies and poor metabolic control and the use of effective contraception at all times unless the patient is in good metabolic control and actively trying to conceive.
The combined oral contraceptive pill is effective if taken reliably, however, the first generation, high dose oestrogen pills should be avoided as they may increase insulin requirement and increase the risk of vascular disease.
The second and third generation pills have a much lower dose of oestrogen and can probably be used safely in the majority of women with diabetes.
The progesterone-only pill is reliable if taken regularly but omission may be more likely to result in pregnancy than with the combined pill.
Injectable progestogens/implants are suitable for some patients.
Intra-uterine contraceptive devices have the advantage of the lack of detrimental metabolic effect and the need for compliance; however, its failure rate is high.
Other methods of contraception such as mechanical contraception can also be used in diabetic patients.
Emergency contraception is safe for diabetic women and should be prescribed if needed.
Optimise glycaemic control: In preparation for pregnancy, oral hypoglycaemic agents should be discontinued and insulin started if needed, statins and ACE-inhibitors should also be discontinued.
Hypertension should be controlled with safer drugs like Methyldopa, Nifedipine or Labetalol.
Regular self-monitoring should be encouraged to optimise control.
Folic Acid should be started at least four weeks pre-conception.
Glycaemic control should be optimised with the aim of pre-prandial blood glucose < 5.5 mmol/l (<95mg/dl) and HbA1c < 7%.
Diabetes ante-natal care: this should be provided in a special clinic and the team caring for pregnant women should ideally include a Diabetes Nurse Specialist, Dietician, Diabetologist and an Obstetrician.
The aim of ante-natal care is to maintain tight glycaemic control and to monitor the mother for diabetes complications.
Tighter glycaemic control has an impact on maternal and foetal complications, therefore, excellent glycaemic control should be continued throughout pregnancy, fasting blood glucose should be kept < 5.5 mmol/l (<95mg/dl), post-prandial glucose < 7.8 mmol/l (<140 mg/dl) and HbA1c < 7%.
Tighter glycaemic control may lead to an increase in episodes of severe hypoglycaemia and worsening of hypoglycaemia unawareness.
The patient should be aware of subtle signs of hypoglycaemia, and the patient's family should be taught the proper treatment of severe hypoglycaemia (i.e.
Glucose monitoring: Home blood glucose monitoring is an essential part of maintaining euglycaemic state and its goal is to detect glucose concentration to allow fine-tuning of insulin adjustment.
Pre-prandial glucose level < 5.5 mmol/l (<95mg/dl), and postprandial level glucose <7.8 mmol/ l (<140mg/dl).
Post-prandial glucose levels have been shown to correlate more with macrosomia than do fasting levels.
Eating three small to moderate size meals and three snacks per day is appropriate.
Monitoring with a pre-breakfast ketone measurement is recommended for patients who are on a hypo-caloric or carbohydrate restricted diet.
Insulin therapy: Insulin regimes should be individualised but in type 1 patients multiple injection/basal bolus regime of human insulin is preferable and in type 2, twice-daily injections may be appropriate.
The aim is to achieve blood glucose as near normal as possible without excessive risk of hypoglycaemia.
Hypoglycaemia: hypoglycaemia is common in pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester.
Education of patients and their families in the recognition and management of hypoglycaemia is vital.
Ketoacidosis: Ketoacidosis is a preventable condition but potentially lethal to the foetus at any stage of pregnancy.
Women should be instructed to test their urine for ketones if their blood glucose readings are high or if they feel unwell.
Retinopathy: Diabetic retinopathy may accelerate during pregnancy.[13] Fundoscopy is necessary before conception and once in each trimester of pregnancy for all women with diabetes.
Nephropathy: [13] Baseline assessment of renal function by serum creatinine and some measure of urinary protein excretion (urine albumin/creatinine ratio or 24-hour albumin excretion) should be undertaken before conception.
Women with microalbuminuria may experience transient worsening during pregnancy; however, those with established nephropathy with overt proteinuria are at increased risk of pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth retardation and premature delivery.
Pregnancy may lead to permanent worsening of renal function in more than 40% of those with serum creatinine of 250 umol/l or greater or creatinine clearance <50ml/minute and therefore it should serve as a contraindication to pregnancy.
However, at that level of impaired renal function fertility is reduced and pregnancy is rare.
ACE-inhibitors for treatment of microalbuminuria should be discontinued in women who are attempting to become pregnant.
Hypertension: Hypertension is a frequent concomitant of diabetes.
Patients with type 1 diabetes frequently develop hypertension in association with diabetic nephropathy, as manifested by the presence of overt proteinuria.
Patients with type 2 diabetes more commonly have hypertension as a concomitant disease.
In addition, pregnancy induced hypertension is a potential problem for women with diabetes.
Hypertension contributes to worsening of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy in pregnancy.
ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers and diuretics should be avoided in women contemplating pregnancy if they are being used for hypertension.
Neuropathy: Compartment syndromes such as carpal tunnel syndrome may be exacerbated by pregnancy and should be treated symptomatically with splints.
Autonomic neuropathy particularly manifested by gastroparesis, hypoglycaemia unawareness, or orthostatic hypertension may complicate the management of diabetes in pregnancy.
These complications should be identified, appropriately evaluated and treated before conception.
Cardiovascular disease: Untreated coronary artery disease is associated with a high mortality rate during pregnancy and women with significant coronary artery disease should be advised against pregnancy.
Foetal monitoring: The major risks for the foetus of a diabetic woman are congenital malformations, intra-uterine death, usually after 30 weeks and macrosomia, which may result in significant problems in labour for both mother and baby.
Ante-natal foetal surveillance must be planned so that each risk is addressed efficiently and in a timely manner.
Ultrasound scanning must be available for assessing gestational age, examining for congenital abnormalities and monitoring foetal growth and liquor volume.
All diabetic patients should be counselled about the possibility of a neural tube defect and offered serum alphafetoprotein blood test between 15 and 19 weeks gestation.
A detailed ultrasound scan at between 20 and 22 weeks for careful assessment of foetal anatomy is mandatory.
The risk of intra-uterine foetal death is increased by a factor of approximately three times, mostly confined to the third trimester.
Although strict control of maternal blood glucose levels will reduce this risk, but not as low as that of the general population.
Ultrasound assessment should be carried out at each visit from 26 weeks.
The programme of surveillance must be modified if there are additional recognised risk factors, such as hypertension or renal disease.
This may mean more frequent ultrasound assessment in addition to umbilical artery Doppler measurement and cardio-tocography.
Unlike in the non-diabetic, it is excessive foetal growth rather than retarded growth that may be associated with the greatest risk.
Increasingly large abdominal circumference in relation to the bi-parietal diameter can be easily monitored by serial ultrasound scans and these two parameters should be measured and documented at each visit, in association with assessment of liquor volume.
Timing of delivery: Uncomplicated case with no evidence of foetal compromise, spontaneous delivery at term is standard practice.
When there are maternal complications of diabetes, complications of pregnancy, previous stillbirth or evidence of abnormal foetal growth, each case must be considered in its own merit with timely delivery in hospital.
Delivery by elective Caesarean section should be considered if the ultrasound estimated foetal weight is > 4kg.
A previous Caesarean section in a diabetic woman will usually be managed by a repeat Caesarean section.
In the absence of these or other obstetric contra-indications a spontaneous vaginal delivery should be possible, with induction of labour as required.
If delivery is indicated before 36 weeks then administration of a steroid to the mother for 48 hours prior to delivery should be undertaken.
Steroids will upset glycaemic control and should only be given on an inpatient basis with careful monitoring of the glucose level and appropriate alteration of the insulin regime.
Management of labour and delivery: Glucose control during labour.
It is necessary to administer IV insulin and Dextrose to prevent ketoacidosis and to maintain the blood glucose as near normal as possible.
The insulin requirements after delivery should return to about the pre-pregnancy level.
Labour and delivery of women with diabetes should be undertaken in units where there is neonatal care.
This would include hypoglycaemia, polycythaemia, respiratory distress syndrome, jaundice, hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesemia.
Routine blood glucose monitoring of the baby should be performed for the first 12 hours.
Insulin requirements fall dramatically at the time of delivery and insulin dose should be reduced to around the pre-pregnancy level.
Breastfeeding also reduces insulin requirements and appropriate reduction should therefore be made once feeding is established.
It is usually possible to stop insulin in women with GDM and in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus who do not intend to breastfeed.
Contraception should be discussed whil the patient is in hospital.
Gestational diabetes mellitus: GDM is defined as a glucose intolerance that begins or is first detected during pregnancy.
Differences in screening programmes and diagnostic criteria make it difficult to compare frequencies of GDM among various populations.
Nevertheless, ethnicity has been proven to be an independent risk factor for GDM, which varies in prevalence in direct proportion to the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in a given population or ethnic group.
The prevalence may range from 1–14% of all pregnancies, depending on the population sample, with 2–5% being the most common rate.[1] GDM develops when a woman is unable to secrete sufficient insulin to compensate for the increased insulin resistance during pregnancy.
The foetus responds to hyperglycaemia by secreting large quantities of insulin.
The result is increasing adiposity and the accrual of visceral fat.
Women who develop GDM are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus.[14] The screening and diagnostic methods for GDM remain controversial, especially the threshold values for the diagnosis.
Maternal risk factors for gestational diabetes Obesity Diabetes in first-degree relative Previous infant with macrosomia Previous diagnosis of GDM Age more than 35 years Polycystic ovary syndrome Multiparity Member of high risk population (e.g.
Perinatal complications of gestational diabetes mellitus Death: still birth and neonatal death Shoulder dystocia Bone fracture Nerve palsy Neonatal hypoglycemia Open in a new tab Such measures will achieve metabolic control in the majority of women.
They should monitor their own blood glucose levels and, if the pre-prandial glucose levels are consistently above 5.5mmol/l (95 mg/dl), insulin should be commenced with the aim of keeping pre-prandial blood glucose below 5.5 mmol/l (95 mg/dl), and two hour post-prandial below 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl).
There is limited data on the safety and efficacy of Glibenclamide or Metformin in GDM.
[20, 21, 22] A 75g oral Glucose Tolerance Test should be performed 6 weeks or more after delivery and the results interpreted by revised WHO criteria.
(Table 7) Women with a history of GDM should be screened for GDM during any future pregnancy.
They should be advised to make life style changes to reduce their risk of subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus.[14] For further reading, readers are advised to refer to the Report of the Expert Committee on the diagnosis and classification of Diabetes Mellitus.
