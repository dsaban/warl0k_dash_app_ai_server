{"qid":"Q001","answer":"Maternal risks\n\nPreeclampsia / gestational hypertension\nPathway: Placental hormones → systemic insulin resistance → endothelial dysfunction + inflammation → hypertension and proteinuria.\n\nCesarean delivery & operative complications\nPathway: Fetal macrosomia → obstructed labor / shoulder dystocia risk → surgical delivery.\n\nProgression to type 2 diabetes (T2DM)\nPathway: Pregnancy unmasks pre-existing β-cell insufficiency; postpartum insulin resistance persists → overt diabetes.\n\nFuture cardiometabolic disease\nPathway: Shared mechanisms of insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and dyslipidemia → long-term vascular risk.\n\nPolyhydramnios\nPathway: Fetal hyperglycemia → osmotic diuresis → increased amniotic fluid volume.\n\nNeonatal / fetal risks\n\nMacrosomia (excess fetal growth)\nPathway (Pedersen hypothesis): Maternal hyperglycemia → placental glucose transfer → fetal hyperinsulinemia → increased fat and shoulder/trunk growth.\n\nShoulder dystocia & birth trauma\nPathway: Disproportionate fetal growth → mechanical delivery complications.\n\nNeonatal hypoglycemia\nPathway: Chronic fetal hyperinsulinemia persists after birth → rapid postnatal glucose drop.\n\nRespiratory distress syndrome (even at term)\nPathway: Insulin antagonizes cortisol → delayed surfactant synthesis → impaired lung maturation.\n\nPreterm birth\nPathway: Polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, or indicated early delivery for maternal/fetal risk.\n\nMetabolic programming (long-term risk)\nPathway: In-utero hyperglycemia → epigenetic and metabolic imprinting → increased lifetime risk of obesity and T2DM."}
