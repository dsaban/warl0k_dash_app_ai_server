Over the past 30 years, great strides have been made in improving the outcomes of women with type 1 diabetes who become pregnant. However, during the past decade, type 2 diabetes in pregnancy has emerged and is certain to become a prominent concern.[3] The St Vincent Declaration, which has been adopted by most European countries, calls for (an outcome in diabetic pregnancy approximating the non-diabetic women).[4] Unfortunately, pregnancy target has been achieved only in a few centres of excellence in Scandinavia and by the small intensive pre-conception control arm of the nine-year US Diabetes Control and Complications Trial.[5] Normal Glucose Regulation during Pregnancy: Metabolic changes occur in normal pregnancy in response to the increase in nutrient needs of the foetus and the mother."}
{"pid": "p00055", "doc": "Diabetes_mellitus_and_pregnancy.txt", "text": "There are two main changes which are seen during pregnancy, progressive insulin resistance that begins near mid-pregnancy and progresses through the third trimester to the level that approximates the insulin resistance seen in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The insulin resistance appears to result from a combination of increased maternal adiposity and the placental secretion of hormones (progesterone, cortisol, placental lactogen, prolactin and growth hormone). The fact that insulin resistance rapidly abates following delivery suggests that the major contributors to this state of resistance are placental hormones."}
