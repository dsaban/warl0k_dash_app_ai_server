Gestational diabetes: update on screening,
diagnosis and maternal management
SUMMARY
Gestational diabetes is common and increasing in prevalence in Australia.
New Australasian consensus recommendations released in June 2025 include higher diagnostic
thresholds for gestational diabetes and guidance on early pregnancy screening. Women with
risk factors for hyperglycaemia in pregnancy are recommended to have glycated haemoglobin
(HbA1c) measured in the first trimester. Women with a previous history of gestational diabetes
or a first-trimester HbA1c of 6.0 to 6.4% should undergo a pregnancy oral glucose tolerance test
(POGTT) before 20 weeks gestation.
All pregnant women without early gestational diabetes or existing diabetes should undergo a
POGTT at 24 to 28 weeks gestation.
Insulin remains the mainstay of pharmacological therapy. Metformin may have a role, but its use
should be evaluated on an individual basis. Other non-insulin antihyperglycaemic therapies are
contraindicated in pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease, and long-term surveillance is indicated.
The management of gestational diabetes
continues to evolve as new data emerge, and
many recommendations are consensus-driven in
the absence of robust evidence. This article aims
to provide an overview of current best-practice
diagnosis and treatment of gestational diabetes in
Australia, focusing on maternal management during
pregnancy and postpartum. It takes into consideration
new consensus recommendations of the Australasian
Diabetes in Pregnancy Society (ADIPS) on screening,
diagnosis and classification of gestational diabetes,
released in June 2025.12
Screening and diagnosis
Recently updated guidelines maintain the
recommendation that all pregnant women without
early gestational diabetes or diabetes already detected
undergo a 75-g 2-hour pregnancy oral glucose
tolerance test (POGTT) at 24 to 28 weeks gestation.1,12
In the updated diagnostic criteria for gestational
diabetes (Table 1), the thresholds for fasting plasma
glucose concentration and POGTT have been raised.4,12
If measures of glycaemia in pregnancy meet the
diagnostic thresholds for diabetes in nonpregnant
adults (Table 1), a diagnosis of ‘overt diabetes
in pregnancy’,12,14 also referred to as ‘diabetes in
pregnancy’,13 is made. These thresholds remain
unchanged in the updated guidelines. Women with
Introduction
Hyperglycaemia that is first noted in pregnancy is
diagnosed as either gestational diabetes, or overt
diabetes in pregnancy (if criteria for diabetes in
nonpregnant adults are met).1
 The incidence and
prevalence of gestational diabetes is increasing
in Australia;2
 almost 54,000 women in 2021 were
diagnosed with gestational diabetes, which has
more than doubled since 2009.3-5 This has been
driven by multiple factors, including increasing
rates of obesity, maternal age and the proportion
of women from ethnic groups with higher risk, and
changes made to diagnostic criteria.6
 The prevalence
of gestational diabetes globally is estimated at
14%, which is consistent with the estimates for the
Australian population.2,7
Gestational diabetes is associated with increased risk
of maternal complications such as pre-eclampsia and,
in the longer term, cardiometabolic disease (including
type 2 diabetes),2
 as well as adverse impacts on the
fetus or neonate, including neonatal hypoglycaemia
and macrosomia.8-10 Timely diagnosis and treatment
according to guidelines is vital to reduce both maternal
and fetal complications of hyperglycaemia.2,8-10 Models
of care for gestational diabetes vary across Australia
depending on local practices, which include step-up
and step-down pathways between usual antenatal
care and specialist antenatal care services.11

overt diabetes in pregnancy should be managed in
pregnancy as if they have pre-existing diabetes.
Early testing for gestational diabetes
Women with risk factors for hyperglycaemia in
pregnancy (Box 1) are recommended to have glycated
haemoglobin (HbA1c) measured in the first trimester
to exclude overt diabetes in pregnancy.12
Women with a previous history of gestational diabetes
or a first-trimester HbA1c of 6.0 to 6.4% (42 to
47 mmol/mol) should have a POGTT before 20 weeks
gestation, ideally between 10 and 14 weeks.1,12 ADIPS
recommends the use of their 2025 diagnostic cut-offs
(Table 1), irrespective of gestational age.12
Clinicians may offer an early screening POGTT
depending on individual risk and discussion with
the patient, even in the absence of prior gestational
diabetes or if HbA1c is below 6.0% (42 mmol/mol).12
Women with risk factors who receive early testing
and have normal glycaemic values should still have
a POGTT at the usual screening period of 24 to
28 weeks gestation.1,12 These individuals are then
managed as per other women who are screened at
24 to 28 weeks.
While early screening for overt diabetes in pregnancy
in women with risk factors is recommended with
broad consensus,1,12 prior to the 2025 ADIPS
recommendations, there were no clear guidelines
on what to do if diagnostic criteria for gestational
diabetes were met earlier than 24 to 28 weeks.1,16 An
Australian-led randomised controlled trial showed that
women diagnosed with gestational diabetes before
20 weeks gestation (using the 2014 ADIPS criteria),
who received immediate treatment compared with
deferred or no treatment, had fewer adverse neonatal
outcomes (24.9% versus 30.5%, adjusted mean
difference −5.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] −10.1 to
−1.2). These included birth before 37 weeks gestation,
birth trauma, birth weight of 4500 g or greater,
respiratory distress, phototherapy, stillbirth, neonatal
death and shoulder dystocia.17 Greater benefit was
seen among the women with glycaemic values in
the higher end of the diagnostic range at the time of
randomisation (fasting glucose 5.3 to 6.0 mmol/L,
1-hour POGTT 10.6 mmol/L or greater, 2-hour POGTT
9.0 to 11.0 mmol/L) compared with those in the lower
end of the range. Early treatment had no effect on
the occurrence of maternal hypertensive disorders in
pregnancy; however, perineal trauma was reduced
by about 78% (0.8% versus 3.6%, adjusted mean
difference −2.8%, 95% CI −4.1 to −1.5).17
With respect to the use of HbA1c in early pregnancy,
a cut-off of 5.4% (35 mmol/mol) was shown to have
low sensitivity (0.55) and specificity (0.67) to predict
fasting or post-load plasma glucose above the 90th
percentile in early POGTT testing, but had modest
value for predicting the need for antihyperglycaemic
drugs (sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.65).18 HbA1c
cut-offs of 5.7% and 5.9% (39 and 41 mmol/mol,

respectively) in early pregnancy have poor sensitivity
for diagnosis of gestational diabetes and, in some
studies, are associated with higher rates of adverse
pregnancy outcomes (e.g. congenital anomaly, preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia, perinatal death).19,20 Use
of HbA1c for screening for gestational diabetes is not
recommended later in pregnancy.12
Management
Management of gestational diabetes includes
patient education, self-monitoring of blood glucose
concentrations, optimising glycaemic management
through lifestyle modifications and, if necessary,
adding antihyperglycaemic therapy.2,21-23 Women
who register for the National Diabetes Services
Scheme (NDSS) get their details added to the
National Gestational Diabetes Register (unless they
opt out). The register provides information, access to
subsidised equipment, advice, and after-pregnancy
reminders to undertake follow-up screening for the
development of permanent diabetes. Management
often utilises a multidisciplinary approach,
with involvement of diabetes nurse educators,
dietitians, general practitioners, endocrinologists
and obstetricians.
Education
Women should be provided with education on
gestational diabetes – what it is, the potential shortterm implications for their own health and that of
their baby in pregnancy (e.g. pregnancy-induced
hypertension, pre-eclampsia, large-for-gestational-age
babies, neonatal hypoglycaemia), as well as the longer
term implications, such as increased risk of type 2
diabetes and cardiovascular disease.2,11,23 They should
also be educated on the need for management and
what this involves, including self-monitoring of blood
glucose concentrations, lifestyle modifications and
addressing modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular
disease.2,11,23 Patient resources are available through
Diabetes Australia and NDSS.
Blood glucose monitoring
The key to management of gestational diabetes is
blood glucose monitoring to ensure glycaemic targets
are met (Table 2). Self-monitoring should be performed
using capillary (finger-prick) blood testing at least
4 times a day, including a fasting concentration, and
a concentration taken 1 or 2 hours after each meal
(breakfast, lunch and dinner). However, due to the
lack of high-quality evidence on optimal targets, there
is some variation across centres in Australia, and local
guidelines may be referred to.11 If targets are not being
achieved following diet and lifestyle modifications,
antihyperglycaemic pharmacological therapy is the
next step in management.
Lifestyle modifications
First-line treatment for optimising glycaemic
management is lifestyle modifications, including
providing advice on physical activity, nutrition, and
weight management, depending on the patient’s prepregnancy weight.2,23 Cultural dietary preferences
need to be taken into consideration when providing
nutritional advice, with a focus on modest intake
of low–glycaemic index carbohydrates.24 Pooled
data from trials that implemented modified dietary
interventions in women with gestational diabetes
found there was a greater reduction in fasting and
postprandial glucose concentrations, and a lower
need for pharmacological therapy, compared with no
dietary intervention. There was also an improvement
in neonatal outcomes, such as lower birth weight and
reduced macrosomia; however, quality of evidence
was low because of limitations in the design of the
trials.25 In a survey of diabetes in pregnancy services
in Australia and New Zealand, diet alone was used
for glycaemic management in 39.4% (ranging from
28.8 to 57.3% across centres) of women diagnosed
with gestational diabetes.26
Pharmacological therapies
In Australia, insulin is the pharmacological therapy of
choice in most centres; however, metformin is also
sometimes used.4
 Other antihyperglycaemic therapies
should not be used in pregnancy.
Insulin
In Australia, insulin is most commonly administered
as multiple daily injections of rapid-acting insulin
analogues, or a single longer acting injection, or
both. Multiple daily injections can be administered
before meals (e.g. NovoRapid [insulin aspart],
Humalog [insulin lispro]) and a longer acting insulin
at night (e.g. Humulin NPH [insulin isophane]).27
Depending on the availability of Humulin NPH,
Optisulin (insulin glargine U100) for the management
of fasting hyperglycaemia may need to be

Gestational diabetes: update on screening, diagnosis and maternal management
considered. Fixed‑dose biphasic insulin, such as
NovoMix 30 (insulin aspart and insulin aspart
protamine) and Humalog Mix25 (insulin lispro and
insulin lispro protamine), may be considered for
patients unable to use multiple daily injections.
There are limited data on the safety and effectiveness
of newer insulin analogues in gestational diabetes,
such as Fiasp (fast-acting insulin aspart), Toujeo
(insulin glargine U300) and Ryzodeg (insulin degludec
and insulin aspart), such that they are not routinely
used for this condition in Australia.
The number of injections and doses depends on the
individual’s glycaemic profile, with rapid-acting insulin
used to manage elevated postprandial glucose and
longer acting insulin used to manage elevated fasting
glucose. Protocols that guide self-titration of insulin
doses are increasingly being used when appropriate.
Metformin
Metformin has been widely used in the treatment
of hyperglycaemia.28 However, there is conflicting
evidence regarding its safety and efficacy in
gestational diabetes. Metformin alone has been
found to be insufficient to achieve adequate
glycaemic management in 14 to 46% of women
with gestational diabetes, necessitating the addition
of insulin therapy.23 However, metformin has been
associated with less maternal weight gain and lower
rates of neonatal hypoglycaemia when compared
with insulin.29
Although metformin crosses the placenta, clinical trial
and observational data have not shown any evidence
of teratogenicity.28 In an open-label randomised
controlled trial of women with gestational diabetes
(n=363), metformin (either alone or in combination
with insulin) was not associated with increased
perinatal complications compared with insulin alone
(32.0% versus 32.2%, respectively).30 In a follow-up
trial, children of women treated with metformin were
assessed at 9 years of age (n=45), and were found
to be larger by various anthropometric measures
(e.g. body weight, waist circumference) than the
children exposed to insulin (n=54).31 However, this
outcome was not observed among children assessed
at 7 years of age (n=58 metformin, n=51 insulin).31
While these findings raise some concern about the
longer term impacts of metformin on the offspring,
interpretation needs to be with caution as there was
incomplete participant follow-up.
A large retrospective, register-based cohort study
found that maternal exposure to metformin (alone
or in combination with insulin) was not correlated
with long-term obesity, dysglycaemia, or diabetes
risk in children compared with insulin alone, but was
associated with increased risk of small-for-gestationalage infants.32 This finding was also reported in a metaanalysis.33 Metformin should therefore be avoided
in the setting of intrauterine growth restriction, in
women with low body mass index and inadequate
weight gain, and in women with pre-eclampsia.
While not currently endorsed by ADIPS for routine
use in the treatment of gestational diabetes, the
appropriateness of metformin use should be
evaluated on an individual basis.4
 Metformin may
be appropriate in the presence of maternal needle
phobia, for limiting insulin use, or in context of
excessive maternal weight gain with insulin. A detailed
discussion with individual women is warranted, clearly
outlining the potential benefits and harms with use
during pregnancy.28
Other antihyperglycaemic therapies
Other non-insulin antihyperglycaemic drugs used for
the treatment of diabetes are not recommended for
the treatment of gestational diabetes in Australia.34
These include sodium-glucose co-transporter 2
inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP‑1) receptor
agonists, dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonists, and
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. These drugs have
limited data on their use in pregnancy and, through
known mechanisms of action, have potential to cause
fetal harm.
Sulfonylureas, with glibenclamide mostly studied, have
been associated with adverse neonatal outcomes,
including macrosomia, hypoglycaemia and respiratory
distress, and are not recommended in Australia.34
Maternal postpartum care and
follow‑up
Approximately 85% of women with gestational
diabetes have resolution of hyperglycaemia following
delivery.35 Insulin therapy, when required, is usually
stopped when active labour starts or delivery via
caesarean section occurs. In the early stages of
labour, or if fasting for a caesarean section, insulin
doses may be reduced (e.g. by about one-third
depending on individual patient factors).
All women diagnosed with gestational diabetes
should undergo a 75-g 2-hour oral glucose tolerance
test 6 to 12 weeks postpartum to check for persistent
hyperglycaemia using the nonpregnant diagnostic
cut-offs (Table 1).1,4 Women who develop gestational
diabetes often have a predisposition to underlying
islet beta cell dysfunction or insulin resistance, which
is unmasked by the added physiological stress
of pregnancy.8
 The recurrence rate of gestational
diabetes in subsequent pregnancies is reported to be
between 39 and 73%.36

Women diagnosed with overt diabetes in pregnancy
should also be re-evaluated after pregnancy, as only
some will meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes
after pregnancy.37
Lifelong surveillance is recommended following
diagnosis of gestational diabetes, as there is increased
risk of developing type 2 diabetes in 50 to 60% of
women 10 years after their pregnancy.2
 Registrants
of the National Gestational Diabetes Register will
receive a ‘Life after gestational diabetes’ booklet
and reminders for diabetes screening. Assessment
of glycaemic management using HbA1c, fasting
plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test should
be performed every 1 to 3 years depending on risk
stratification and future pregnancy plans.4,23 In women
planning another pregnancy after gestational diabetes,
the oral glucose tolerance test is the optimal test for
diagnosis of prediabetes. As gestational diabetes is
also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease (twofold), cardiovascular disease risk factors
should be regularly assessed and managed.38
Optimisation of lifestyle factors remains key in
prevention of progression to type 2 diabetes.
Surveillance provides an avenue for early detection
and subsequent commencement of appropriate
therapies to prevent progression to uncontrolled
hyperglycaemia and diabetes-related complications.
Conclusion
All women should be screened at 24 to 28 weeks
gestation, and those with high-risk features should be
tested in early pregnancy. Lifestyle modifications, plus
insulin if pharmacological therapy is required, remain
the mainstay of treatment. All women diagnosed
with gestational diabetes should be screened
lifelong for the development of type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease.
