31 y/o pregnant woman, 24 weeks gestation.
BMI: 29.8

Notes: discussing insulin resistance of pregnancy and need for compensatory increase in insulin secretion.
Concern that beta-cell compensation may be inadequate → risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
Fasting glucose: 98 mg/dl

Will schedule OGTT screening and counsel on postpartum diabetes screening with 75g OGTT at 4–12 weeks if GDM confirmed.
